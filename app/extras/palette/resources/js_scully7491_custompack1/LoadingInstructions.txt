How To Load Custom Gradients:

Note: You must have Apophysis for these gradients to work, they are not formatted for Photoshop or any other graphics program.  
A full version of Apophysis can be downloaded FREE at : http://www.apophysis.org

Download the file to a place you can remember and then unzip it (also to a place you can remember lol).  You can get unzipping programs
all over the web or winzip.com.

1. Load Apopysis (duh lol)
2. Press CTRL and G to open the gradient menu (or go to the top of the screen where the icons are and press the button that has
a square with stripes colored blue white and orange)
3. At the bottom of the gradient menu there is a slidebar and to the far right 4 icons.  Click on the third icon (should say "Gradient Browser" 
when the mouse is hovered over it).
4. A new menu will open; go once again to the bottom right and click on the folder.  Locate the file you downloaded and load it.
5. Double click on the title of the gradient (ie Alien) to load it in Apophysis.

IF you use anywhere (website, Deviant Art, Sheezy Art etc) you must provide credit in the form of a link back to:
